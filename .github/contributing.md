# üìõ PDFtoIMG-JS Contributing Guide

Hi there! üëã We're thrilled that you're considering contributing to **PDFtoIMG-JS**.  
Before you start, please read through the following guidelines to help keep the project clean, organized, and welcoming:

- [Pull Request Guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines)
- [Development Setup](#development-setup)
- [Project Structure](#project-structure)

---

## ‚úÖ Pull Request Guidelines

- **Branching:**

  - Always create a feature/fix branch from `main` (example: `feature/add-scale-option`, `fix/pdf-load-issue`).
  - Open pull requests against the `main` branch.

- **If adding a new feature:**

  - Please open an issue first to discuss it, unless it's very small.
  - Provide a clear explanation of what the feature does and why it's needed.

- **If fixing a bug:**

  - Explain the bug in the PR description.
  - Provide a test case or reproducible example if possible (e.g., a file in `/example`).

- **Commits:**

  - It's fine to have multiple small commits; GitHub will allow squashing before merging.
  - Write meaningful commit messages:
    - Use the **imperative mood** (e.g., `Fix broken PDF loading` instead of `Fixed broken PDF loading`).
    - Reference related issues: (`Fixes #42`, `Closes #56`).

- **Code Style:**

  - Use the existing ESLint and Prettier rules.
  - Before submitting, run:
    ```bash
    yarn lint
    yarn format
    ```

- **Testing:**
  - Make sure your changes pass existing tests.
  - If needed, add new tests in the `test/` directory.
